# Velo Ladder — Handoff

Weighted-ball velocity tracker for Cole Thomas's pitching athletes (FAST Performance,
Denver). Coach manages a roster; each athlete logs in and tracks their own mound and
pull-down velocity.

## Status: live and in use

| | |
|---|---|
| **Live** | https://velo-ladder.vercel.app |
| **Repo** | https://github.com/colethomas5280-sudo/velo-ladder |
| **Hosting** | Vercel — org "FAST Baseball" (Hobby plan), auto-deploys on push to `main` |
| **Database** | Supabase (project ref `shrqazkodfiruilfhpwe`), Transaction pooler |
| **Coach login** | `cole@fastcolorado.com` + `COACH_PASSWORD` env var (revealable in Vercel) |

Everything below is working and verified: password login, per-athlete authorization,
the roster/spreadsheet home page, athlete profile pages, single- and multi-athlete
session entry, the 3-line progress chart, CSV export.

**Last commit:** `7043317` (3-line progress chart). Also one uncommitted cleanup
(removed the now-orphaned `RosterManager.tsx`) — commit + push it. Confirm the repo on
GitHub is at the latest commit.

## Outstanding — do these soon

1. **Rotate the three secrets that passed through the chat build session:**
   `AUTH_SECRET`, `SETUP_KEY`, and the **Supabase database password**. For each:
   edit it in Vercel → **Settings → Environment Variables**, then **Deployments →
   Redeploy**. For the DB password also reset it in Supabase (**Settings → Database →
   Reset database password**) — use a letters-and-numbers-only password, put the exact
   same string in Supabase and in `DATABASE_URL`, wait ~2 min for the pooler to
   propagate, then redeploy.
2. **Delete the dead `EMAIL_*` env vars** in Vercel (`EMAIL_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS/FROM`).
   The app no longer sends email — login is password-based.
3. **Re-run DB setup after any schema change:**
   `https://velo-ladder.vercel.app/api/setup?key=<SETUP_KEY>&seed=1` — idempotent,
   safe to hit anytime.

## Architecture

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack), **React 19**, TypeScript.
- **Auth.js v5 beta** — Credentials provider, JWT sessions, **no database adapter**.
  Coach = any `COACH_EMAILS` address + shared `COACH_PASSWORD`. Athlete = their
  `invite_email` + a bcrypt password the coach sets. `lib/auth.ts`.
- **Postgres** via `pg` (node-postgres) — works with any Postgres. Local dev uses
  **PGlite** (in-process, `USE_PGLITE=1`). `lib/db.ts`.
- **Client data** via SWR against REST route handlers. No global state library.
- Charts are hand-drawn on `<canvas>` (`components/ProgressChart.tsx`).

### Routes

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `/` | Coach → the Athletes roster. Athlete → redirected to their own profile. |
| `/athletes/[id]` | One athlete's profile: entry form, PR/Avg/Floor per weight, progress chart, session history. |
| `/login` | Email + password. |
| `/api/me` | `{ role, email, athleteId }` for the signed-in user. |
| `/api/athletes` | GET (scoped list), POST (coach: create). |
| `/api/athletes/overview` | GET — roster + session counts + last date (coach only). Powers the home table. |
| `/api/athletes/[id]` | GET / PATCH (name, email, hand, password, archive) / DELETE (soft). |
| `/api/athletes/[id]/sessions` | GET / POST. |
| `/api/sessions/[id]` | PATCH / DELETE. |
| `/api/setup?key=…&seed=1` | One-time (idempotent) schema + seed. `SETUP_KEY`-guarded. |
| `/api/auth/*` | Auth.js. |

Every API route calls `getScope()` (`lib/scope.ts`) and enforces: **coach** = all
athletes; **athlete** = their own only; anyone else = 403.

### Key components

- `HomeView` → `AthletesTable` (spreadsheet: inline-edit email/hand/password, add,
  remove, search; check rows → **`GroupSession`** modal).
- `AthleteProfile` → `Masthead` + `EntryForm` + `ProgressChart` + `HistoryTable`
  + password box.
- `GroupSession` → `GroupEntryModal` wrapping `EntryForm` — athlete tabs, per-athlete
  draft, "Save all N" / "Save one".
- `EntryForm` — the weight lanes; each shows PR/Avg/Floor for that weight, `last` +
  throw count, and a live `max·avg·new PR` while typing.

### Data model (`lib/schema.ts`, `db/schema.sql`)

```
athletes(id, name, hand, invite_email, password_hash, archived, created_at)
training_sessions(id, athlete_id, type['mound'|'pulldown'], date, notes,
                  throws jsonb, created_by, created_at, updated_at)
```

`throws` shape: `{ "p1": [primer, t1, t2, t3], ... }` — index 0 is the **80% primer
(never scored)**; indices 1–3 are the 100% throws that feed every stat. `null` = blank.

### Tracker config (`lib/velo.ts` → `TRACKERS`)

- **Mound:** weights `5, 6, 7, 4, 3` oz — slots `m5,m6,m7,m4,m3`, one record group each.
- **Pull-Down:** weights `5, 6, 7, 5, 4, 3` oz — slots `p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6`. The two 5 oz
  sets (`p1` opener, `p4` "2nd 5oz") **fold into ONE combined 5 oz record** (Cole's
  explicit call) — one PR / avg / floor / chart line / history column. The expanded
  history detail still shows each set separately.

## Local development

Node is installed via **nvm** (`~/.nvm`, Node v24). If `node` isn't found, run:
`export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.20.0/bin:$PATH"` (or `. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh`).

```bash
cd ~/velo-ladder
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local          # USE_PGLITE=1 is set — no external DB needed
#   set AUTH_SECRET and COACH_PASSWORD in .env.local
npm run dev
# then hit once:  http://localhost:3000/api/setup?key=dev-setup-key&seed=1
# sign in with COACH_EMAILS + COACH_PASSWORD from .env.local
```

`npm run build` for a production build. The local DB file is `./.pglite-data/`
(gitignored) — `rm -rf .pglite-data` to reset.

### Production env vars (Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables)

| Name | Notes |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Supabase **Transaction pooler** URI, port 6543, password URL-encoded |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | random 40+ chars (`openssl rand -base64 33`) |
| `AUTH_URL` | `https://velo-ladder.vercel.app` |
| `COACH_EMAILS` | `cole@fastcolorado.com` (comma-separated for multiple coaches) |
| `COACH_PASSWORD` | shared coach password |
| `SETUP_KEY` | random string, used for `/api/setup` |

## Gotchas learned (read before next session)

- **PGlite does not work inside React Server Components** — throws
  `The "path" argument must be of type string … Received an instance of URL`.
  All database access goes through **route handlers only**; pages call `auth()`
  (session/JWT, no DB) and everything else is client-fetched. Keep this pattern even
  though real Postgres in RSC would technically work.
- **Vercel env var changes require a redeploy** to take effect.
- **Supabase password resets** propagate to the pooler after ~2 min; the password in
  `DATABASE_URL` must exactly match what was set in Supabase. Letters+numbers only
  avoids URL-encoding pain.
- **Email login was abandoned** — Google Workspace (`fastcolorado.com`, which Cole
  doesn't administer) blocks app passwords, and Resend needs a domain Cole can't add
  DNS to. Password auth replaced it entirely.
- **`next-auth` is on a beta** (`5.0.0-beta.32`). Credentials + JWT, no adapter.
- **In-progress entry is saved to `localStorage`** keyed
  `veloladder:draft:<athleteId>:<tracker>` — this is what makes tab-switching in the
  group modal lossless across reloads.

## Next steps / open questions

Cole plans to **"add a whole bunch of other things" to the athlete profile page** —
scope undefined. Likely candidates, none confirmed:

- More views/metrics on the profile (the old TRAQ system had org / team / level /
  status columns on its athlete list, and a "Meaning: max 👁" per-weight metric
  toggle — Cole declined the toggle earlier; revisit if asked).
- Filters / columns on the Athletes roster table.
- `training_sessions.created_by` is recorded but never shown — could surface "logged
  by coach vs. self".
- No pull-down vs. mound cross-comparison view yet.
- No date-range filtering on the progress chart or history.

**Open question:** confirm the 3-line progress chart colors read clearly on Cole's
screen (best = amber, average = blue, floor = green) — couldn't verify visually
during the build.
